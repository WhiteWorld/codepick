# Bailian Coding Plan vs Volcengine Ark Coding Plan: 2026 Deep Comparison

Bailian Coding Plan (by Alibaba Cloud) and Volcengine Ark Coding Plan (by ByteDance) are the two leading China-native AI coding API subscription plans. Both offer developer-focused subscription-based coding request quotas at similar price points, but they differ significantly in quota mechanisms, model ecosystems, and client support.

Bailian offers a monthly total quota (up to 90,000 requests/month on Pro), making it ideal for burst usage, and features 8 models including the full Qwen Coder lineup. Ark uses a rolling 5-hour window for rate limiting, supports Auto mode for intelligent model selection, and offers native Anthropic API protocol compatibility — making it the preferred choice for Claude Code users and multi-client setups with 11 supported clients.
