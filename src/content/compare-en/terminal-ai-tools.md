# Terminal AI Coding Big Three: Claude Code vs OpenCode vs Aider

For developers who prefer terminal-based workflows, there are three primary AI coding tool choices: Anthropic's Claude Code, the rising open-source project OpenCode, and the veteran CLI tool Aider. This article provides a detailed comparison of their Agent capabilities, Git integration, model support, pricing, and China accessibility.

Claude Code offers the strongest Agent capabilities with MCP tool support, sub-agent parallel execution, and deep thinking mode via Claude Opus 4.6, but it comes at a higher cost and requires a proxy in China. OpenCode is an open-source Claude Code alternative written in Go that supports multiple models (DeepSeek, Qwen, Claude, GPT) via OpenAI-compatible APIs, making it ideal for Chinese developers without VPN access. Aider is the most established option with the best Git integration (automatic meaningful commits), Python extensibility, and extreme cost efficiency when paired with DeepSeek (as low as $1/month).
