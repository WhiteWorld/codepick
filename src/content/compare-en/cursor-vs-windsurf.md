Cursor and Windsurf are the two most popular VS Code Fork AI IDEs on the market today. While their features overlap significantly, they differ in pricing, model strategy, and core experience. This article provides a comprehensive comparison from a practical usage perspective.

## At a Glance

| Dimension | Cursor | Windsurf |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Pricing (Pro) | $20/mo | $15/mo |
| Free Tier | Limited quota | 25 credits/mo |
| Flagship Model | Claude Sonnet 4.5 / GPT-5 | Claude Sonnet 3.7 / SWE-1.5 |
| Code Completion | Tab (ultra-fast) | Tab + Supercomplete |
| Agent Framework | Composer | Cascade |
| JetBrains Support | No | Yes |
| China Friendliness | 2/5 stars | 2/5 stars |

## Pricing Comparison

**Cursor** Pro is priced at $20/mo, using a usage quota pool system ($20 included usage per month), with per-token billing after exceeding the quota; Auto mode allows unlimited use of low-cost models.

**Windsurf** Pro is priced at $15/mo, including 500 credits/month. Credits are shared across Cascade conversations and premium completions, with additional credits available at $10/250 credits.

> **Bottom line**: Windsurf is $5 cheaper per month. If your monthly usage is consistent, Windsurf offers better value. However, Cursor's Auto mode "unlimited" usage policy is more friendly for heavy users.

---

## Coding Capabilities

**Cursor** connects to the full suite of top-tier models including Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Its Composer Agent delivers a mature multi-step code generation experience, with large-scale project refactoring as a particular strength.

**Windsurf's** Cascade is its key differentiator — it's not just a chat interface, but a continuously context-aware "streaming Agent" that proactively identifies issues and suggests fixes. Its proprietary SWE-1.5 model balances both speed and quality on coding tasks.

> **Bottom line**: Overall capability is slightly stronger with Cursor (thanks to access to more top-tier models), but Windsurf Cascade's context-awareness provides a unique experience, and its everyday coding fluency rivals Cursor's.

---

## Code Completion

Both tools offer Tab-triggered code completion:

- **Cursor Tab**: Widely recognized as one of the fastest and most accurate completions available, with strong multi-line prediction capabilities
- **Windsurf Supercomplete**: Builds on Tab completion with "cross-file awareness," predicting changes needed in the current file based on modifications in other files

> **Bottom line**: If you're extremely sensitive to completion speed, Cursor Tab is smoother; if you frequently perform cross-file refactoring, Windsurf Supercomplete has the edge.

## Model Support

| Model | Cursor | Windsurf |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Yes | Yes |
| Claude Opus 4.6 | Yes | No |
| GPT-5 | Yes | Yes (GPT-4o) |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | Yes | Yes |
| Proprietary Model | cursor-small | SWE-1.5 |

Cursor has a slight edge in top-tier model coverage; Windsurf's proprietary SWE-1.5 is its unique asset.

## IDE Extension Support

- **Cursor**: VS Code ecosystem only, no JetBrains support
- **Windsurf**: In addition to its VS Code Fork IDE, offers JetBrains and Vim/Neovim plugins

> If you also use IntelliJ / PyCharm / GoLand, Windsurf is the only option.

---

## Who Should Choose Which?

**Choose Cursor if you:**
- Need access to the latest and most powerful models (Opus 4.6, GPT-5)
- Are already comfortable with the Cursor workflow and don't want to migrate
- Are a heavy user who values Auto mode's unlimited usage

**Choose Windsurf if you:**
- Have a limited budget and want to save $5/mo
- Use JetBrains IDEs or Vim
- Prefer Cascade's "proactive awareness" experience
- Need centralized billing management for team collaboration

---

## Summary

Cursor and Windsurf are currently neck and neck, with fierce competition driving rapid iteration on both sides. The core differences:

- **Cursor** = Most comprehensive model access + Fastest completions + Largest ecosystem
- **Windsurf** = More affordable + JetBrains support + Unique Cascade experience

If you have no prior commitment to either, both are worth trying via their free tiers before deciding which one to pay for.
