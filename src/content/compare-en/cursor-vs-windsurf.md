# Cursor vs Windsurf 2026: Ultimate Comparison of Two VS Code Forks

Cursor and Windsurf are the two most popular VS Code Fork AI IDEs on the market. While their features overlap significantly, they differ in pricing, model strategy, and core experience. This article covers pricing (Cursor at $20/mo vs Windsurf at $15/mo), coding capabilities, code completion, model support, and IDE extension compatibility.

Cursor leads with access to the latest top-tier models (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5), industry-best Tab completion speed, and the largest user ecosystem. Windsurf counters with a lower price point, JetBrains/Vim plugin support, a unique Cascade context-aware "streaming Agent" experience, and its proprietary SWE-1.5 model that balances speed and quality. Both tools are locked in fierce competition and iterating rapidly.
