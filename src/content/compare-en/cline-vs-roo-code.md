# Cline vs Roo Code: Which Open-Source VS Code Agent Is Better?

Cline and Roo Code are the two highest-download open-source AI Agent plugins on the VS Code Marketplace. Both are fully open-source, support custom model APIs, and work in any VS Code-compatible environment. Roo Code originated as a fork of Cline but has since developed many unique features of its own.

Cline is the more stable and conservative choice, with better error recovery, stricter permission controls, and official team maintenance — making it ideal for production environments and newcomers to AI-assisted coding. Roo Code offers more advanced features like multi-mode configurations, Boomerang Tasks (Orchestrator Mode) for parallel sub-agent execution, and more aggressive auto-approval settings — appealing to power users who want cutting-edge capabilities and are comfortable with occasional instability.
