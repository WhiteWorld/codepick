# Gemini CLI vs Claude Code vs Codex CLI: Three Free Terminal Agents Compared (2026)

Between 2025 and 2026, all three major tech giants released their own terminal AI coding agents: Google's Gemini CLI, Anthropic's Claude Code, and OpenAI's Codex CLI. All three run in the terminal and support MCP, but they differ significantly in pricing models, free quotas, and capability focus.

Gemini CLI offers the most generous free tier (1,000 requests/day with a personal Google account) and a massive 1-million-token context window, making it the best zero-cost entry point — especially for processing large codebases. Claude Code uses Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 and is widely regarded as producing the highest code quality, excelling in complex reasoning, architecture design, and Git workflow automation. Codex CLI requires ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) and leverages OpenAI's o3/o4-mini reasoning models, with advantages in algorithmic and mathematical tasks and a polished full-screen TUI interface.
