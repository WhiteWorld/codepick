# Cursor vs GitHub Copilot: 2026 Ultimate Comparison

Cursor and GitHub Copilot are the two most mainstream paid AI coding tools today. Cursor is a standalone IDE based on VS Code, while Copilot is deeply integrated into the GitHub ecosystem. This article provides a detailed comparison across multiple dimensions including pricing, coding capabilities, Agent mode, IDE compatibility, and model selection.

Cursor excels in Agent capabilities with its mature Composer-based multi-file autonomous editing, terminal command execution, and MCP tool integration — making it the top choice for heavy AI-driven development. GitHub Copilot offers broader IDE compatibility (JetBrains, Neovim, Visual Studio) at half the price ($10/mo vs $20/mo), making it ideal for developers who use non-VS Code editors or are deeply embedded in the GitHub PR/Issues workflow.
