Cursor and GitHub Copilot are the two most mainstream paid AI coding tools today. Cursor is a standalone IDE based on VS Code, while Copilot is deeply integrated into the GitHub ecosystem. This article provides a detailed comparison across multiple dimensions.

## One-Sentence Summary

- **Cursor**: Strongest Agent capabilities — ideal for power users who need AI to autonomously handle multi-file edits
- **GitHub Copilot**: Broadest IDE compatibility — ideal for JetBrains users or those deeply invested in the GitHub ecosystem

## Pricing Comparison

| Item | Cursor | GitHub Copilot |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Free Tier | Yes (limited usage) | Yes (limited usage) |
| Individual Plan | $20/mo | $10/mo |
| Value Rating | 3/5 stars | 4/5 stars |

Copilot's individual plan at $10/mo is roughly half the price of Cursor Pro. However, Cursor's $20 plan includes a $20 usage pool, and actual Agent usage typically far exceeds what Copilot offers.

## Coding Capabilities

### Code Completion

Both support real-time inline completion with a similar experience. Cursor's Tab completion has a slight edge in large file scenarios, as it can "predict" your next cursor movement.

### Chat / Conversation

Cursor natively supports multi-file context (Codebase Chat), enabling Q&A across the entire project. Copilot Chat in the VS Code plugin also supports `@workspace`, but its project indexing quality is slightly inferior.

### Agent Mode

This is where the gap between the two is largest:

- **Cursor Agent**: Supports multi-file autonomous editing, terminal command execution, and MCP tool integration. It is currently the most mature IDE Agent implementation on the market.
- **Copilot Agent (Coding Agent)**: Launched in 2025 and still in beta. Strong in conversational ability, but autonomous task execution is weaker than Cursor.

## IDE Support

| IDE | Cursor | Copilot |
|-----|--------|---------|
| VS Code | Yes (built-in) | Yes |
| JetBrains | No | Yes |
| Neovim | No | Yes |
| Visual Studio | No | Yes |

**JetBrains users must choose Copilot.** Cursor is a VS Code Fork and does not support IntelliJ-based IDEs.

---

## China Accessibility

| Item | Cursor | Copilot |
|------|--------|---------|
| Domestic Access | Requires proxy | Requires proxy |
| Stability | Average | Average |

Both require a stable proxy and are difficult to use in China without one. If you don't have proxy access, consider [Cline + Volcengine Ark Coding Plan](https://www.volcengine.com/L/s3lNTNYxaEc/) ([plan details](/plan/cline-ark)).

---

## Model Selection

- **Cursor**: Built-in Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and more — usage drawn from a quota pool
- **Copilot**: Supports Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro — Enterprise edition supports additional models

Neither allows you to use your own API key freely (Cursor has a BYO API option, but with significant restrictions).

---

## Recommendations

**Choose Cursor if you:**
- Primarily use VS Code / Cursor-family editors
- Need powerful Agent capabilities for autonomous task execution
- Work on large projects with multi-file refactoring
- Are willing to pay more for the best AI coding experience

**Choose Copilot if you:**
- Use JetBrains, Neovim, or other IDEs
- Have a limited budget (starting at $10/mo)
- Are deeply embedded in the GitHub PR/Issues workflow
- Need unified team management (Copilot for Business)

## Overall Scores

| Dimension | Cursor | Copilot |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Coding Ability | 9.5/10 | 8.5/10 |
| Value for Money | 6/10 | 8/10 |
| IDE Compatibility | 5/10 | 9/10 |
| China Experience | 4/10 | 4/10 |
| Agent Capabilities | 9.5/10 | 7/10 |
