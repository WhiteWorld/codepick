# Kiro vs Cursor 2026: AWS Spec-Driven IDE vs the Reigning AI Coding King

Cursor is currently the most popular AI IDE, while Kiro is AWS's 2025 challenger. Both are built on VS Code and support Claude models, but their core philosophies are fundamentally different. Cursor focuses on "efficient interaction" — faster completions, stronger Agent, smoother multi-step editing. Kiro focuses on "prototype to production" — using Specs (specification documents) to generate requirements and design docs before the Agent writes any code.

Kiro's standout features include Specs (generating requirements.md and design.md before coding), Hooks (automatically triggering Agent tasks on events like file saves or test failures), and structured Steering Rules. Cursor counters with a more mature ecosystem, broader model selection (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), and industry-leading Tab completion. Kiro is currently in free public preview, making it a low-risk option to try.
