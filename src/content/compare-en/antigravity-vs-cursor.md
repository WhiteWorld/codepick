# Antigravity vs Cursor 2026: Google's Newcomer vs the AI IDE Champion

In November 2025, Google launched Antigravity — an Agentic IDE released alongside Gemini 3. It directly challenges Cursor's dominance. Both tools are built on VS Code and support Claude models, but their design philosophies differ significantly. This article compares their pricing, Agent architecture, model support, code completion, maturity, and China accessibility to help you determine which IDE best fits your workflow.

Antigravity's Agent-First architecture supports multiple agents running in parallel across the editor, terminal, and built-in browser, with Artifacts for pre-code verification. Cursor, on the other hand, offers a more mature Composer-based workflow with industry-leading Tab completion and production-grade stability backed by SOC 2 certification.
