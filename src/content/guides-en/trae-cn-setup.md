# Trae CN Complete Getting Started Guide: Free AI IDE for China, Zero-Cost AI Coding

Trae CN is ByteDance's China-edition AI IDE built on VS Code. It is completely free, requires no VPN, and comes with built-in access to top Chinese coding models including Doubao Seed Code, DeepSeek V3/R1, Kimi K2, GLM-4.5, and Qwen3-Coder. For developers in China, this is currently the best zero-cost starting point for AI-assisted coding.

This guide covers downloading and installing Trae CN, account registration, navigating the interface (AI Chat panel and SOLO workspace), selecting the right model for your task, using Chat mode for interactive coding, and leveraging SOLO mode for autonomous development. SOLO Coder handles feature additions and refactoring on existing projects, while SOLO Builder creates entire applications from scratch — complete with requirements documents, dependency installation, and local preview. The guide also compares Trae CN with Cursor and explains the differences between Trae CN and the international version (trae.ai).
