# Ollama + Aider Local Deployment Complete Guide

This guide covers how to set up a fully local AI coding environment using **Ollama** (local model runtime) and **Aider** (AI coding assistant). This approach is completely free with no API costs, keeps all code on your machine for maximum data security, requires no VPN or external services, and can work entirely offline once models are downloaded.

The step-by-step instructions walk you through installing Ollama, downloading recommended coding models (Qwen 2.5 Coder in 7B/14B/32B sizes), installing Aider via pip or pipx, configuring Aider to connect to Ollama through its OpenAI-compatible interface, and using Aider effectively in your projects. The guide also covers GPU acceleration for NVIDIA and Apple Silicon, performance tuning, a comparison against cloud-based alternatives, and common troubleshooting tips.
