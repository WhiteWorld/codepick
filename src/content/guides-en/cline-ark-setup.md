# Cline + Volcengine Ark Coding Plan Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the **Cline + Volcengine Ark Coding Plan** — currently the most cost-effective AI coding solution for developers in China, starting at just 9.9 CNY/month with no VPN required and access to multiple top-tier coding models.

The setup process covers subscribing to a Volcengine Ark Coding Plan (Lite or Pro), obtaining an API key from the Volcengine console, installing the Cline extension in VS Code, configuring Cline to connect to Ark via the OpenAI Compatible provider with the dedicated `/api/coding/v3` endpoint, and testing the connection. The guide also includes tips on supported models (Doubao-Seed-Code, DeepSeek-V3.2, GLM-4.7, Kimi-K2.5, Auto mode), request limits, MCP integration, and custom system prompts.
